# Storm
Spotify App designed for music discovery. Uses a set of user defined playlists to aggegate new releases across all artists and put them in one spot for listening. As opposed to simplified approaches that only focus on what's popular, the storm methods look across all artists in defined playlists and report back to the user with all the music they might've missed. It may be a little more for the listener to manage, but one can be confident they will not miss a track.
